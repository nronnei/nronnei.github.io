# Transit to Green Space Project - A Web Map for the North Star Sierra Club (NSSC)

This is the GNU GPL Licensed repo for the TtGS Project. I'm learning how to use GitHub for the first time to make this project go more smoothly. Collaboration is key, and that's why GitHub exists!

The goal of our project is to help people reach parks in the Twin Cities Metro using Public Transit. Based on data provided by the NSSC, we are creating a Google Map via the JS V3 API that finds a user with geolocation, provides several park options for them to visit, and gives them directions to a park of their choosing.

UPDATE: Most of the dragons (remember, 'Dragons be here!'?) have been slain. I'm certain that this code would probably make experienced developers cringe, so if any of you magical warlocks stumble across this project and have some free time to look at it, I would be forever ingratiated. The project has accomplished all core objectives and we are now moving into UI/UX improvements.
